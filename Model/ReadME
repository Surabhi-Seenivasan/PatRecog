Okay so. there should be another file called the similarity.pkl file and the actual data .csv file itself but they are pretty huge. I'll try to upload later. but in case I can't, 
1. The similarity.pkl file is autogenerated so you van't open it and stuff, so there's no use if I put it
2. the csv file is here -> https://github.com/nlptown/nlp-notebooks/blob/master/data/arxiv/arxiv.csv
